Libraries
=========

Set up your development environment to use the OpenAI API with an SDK in your preferred language.

This page covers setting up your local development environment to use the [OpenAI API](/docs/api-reference). You can use one of our officially supported SDKs, a community library, or your own preferred HTTP client.

Create and export an API key
----------------------------

Before you begin, [create an API key in the dashboard](/api-keys), which you'll use to securely [access the API](/docs/api-reference/authentication). Store the key in a safe location, like a [`.zshrc` file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-do-zsh-configuration-files-work/) or another text file on your computer. Once you've generated an API key, export it as an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) in your terminal.

macOS / Linux

Export an environment variable on macOS or Linux systems

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Windows

Export an environment variable in PowerShell

```bash
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

OpenAI SDKs are configured to automatically read your API key from the system environment.

Install an official SDK
-----------------------

JavaScript

To use the OpenAI API in server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js, Deno, or Bun, you can use the official [OpenAI SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node). Get started by installing the SDK using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or your preferred package manager:

Install the OpenAI SDK with npm

```bash
npm install openai
```

With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called `example.mjs` and copy the example code into it:

Test a basic API request

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

Execute the code with `node example.mjs` (or the equivalent command for Deno or Bun). In a few moments, you should see the output of your API request.

Python

To use the OpenAI API in Python, you can use the official [OpenAI SDK for Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python). Get started by installing the SDK using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

Install the OpenAI SDK with pip

```bash
pip install openai
```

With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called `example.py` and copy the example code into it:

Test a basic API request

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Execute the code with `python example.py`. In a few moments, you should see the output of your API request.

.NET

In collaboration with Microsoft, OpenAI provides an officially supported API client for C#. You can install it with the .NET CLI from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

```text
dotnet add package OpenAI
```

A simple API request to the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) would look like this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using OpenAI;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var client = new OpenAIClient(
            Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        );

        var response = await client.Responses.CreateAsync(new ResponseCreateRequest
        {
            Model = "gpt-5",
            Input = "Say 'this is a test.'"
        });

        Console.WriteLine($"[ASSISTANT]: {response.OutputText}");
    }
}
```

Java

OpenAI provides an API helper for the Java programming language, currently in beta. You can include the Maven dependency using the following configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.openai</groupId>
  <artifactId>openai-java</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

A simple API request to [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) would look like this:

```java
import com.openai.client.OpenAIClient;
import com.openai.client.okhttp.OpenAIOkHttpClient;
import com.openai.models.responses.Response;
import com.openai.models.responses.ResponseCreateParams;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create client from environment variables
        OpenAIClient client = OpenAIOkHttpClient.fromEnv();

        ResponseCreateParams params = ResponseCreateParams.builder()
                .input("Say this is a test")
                .model("gpt-5")
                .build();

        Response response = client.responses().create(params);
        System.out.println(response.outputText());
    }
}
```

Go

OpenAI provides an API helper for the Go programming language, currently in beta. You can import the library using the code below:

```golang
import (
  "github.com/openai/openai-go" // imported as openai
)
```

A simple API request to the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) would look like this:

```golang
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/openai/openai-go/v3"
	"github.com/openai/openai-go/v3/option"
)

func main() {
	client := openai.NewClient(
		option.WithAPIKey("My API Key"), // or set OPENAI_API_KEY in your env
	)

	resp, err := client.Responses.New(context.TODO(), openai.ResponseNewParams{
		Model: openai.F("gpt-5"),
		Input: openai.F("Say this is a test"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	fmt.Println(resp.OutputText)
}
```
