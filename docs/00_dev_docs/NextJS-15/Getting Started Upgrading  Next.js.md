## Upgrading

## Latest version

To update to the latest version of Next.js, you can use the `upgrade` codemod:

Terminal

\`\`\`
npx @next/codemod@latest upgrade latest
\`\`\`

If you prefer to upgrade manually, install the latest Next.js and React versions:

Terminal

\`\`\`
pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
\`\`\`

## Canary version

To update to the latest canary, make sure you're on the latest version of Next.js and everything is working as expected. Then, run the following command:

Terminal

\`\`\`
npm i next@canary
\`\`\`
