## Installation

## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.

## Automatic installation

The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

Terminal

\`\`\`
npx create-next-app@latest
\`\`\`

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

Terminal

\`\`\`
pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
\`\`\`

> **Good to know**: The App Router uses [React canary releases](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries) built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks. The Pages Router uses the React version you install in `package.json`.

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

package.json

\`\`\`
{

  "scripts": {

    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",

    "build": "next build",

    "start": "next start",

    "lint": "eslint"

  }

}
\`\`\`

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `next dev --turbopack`: Starts the development server using Turbopack.
- `next build`: Builds the application for production.
- `next start`: Starts the production server.
- `eslint`: Runs ESLint.

Turbopack is stable for `dev`. For production builds, Turbopack is in beta. To try it, run `next build --turbopack`. See the [Turbopack docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack) for status and caveats.

### Create the app directory

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

Create an `app` folder. Then, inside `app`, create a `layout.tsx` file. This file is the [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout). It's required and must contain the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

app/layout.tsx

\`\`\`
export default function RootLayout({

  children,

}: {

  children: React.ReactNode

}) {

  return (

    <html lang="en">

      <body>{children}</body>

    </html>

  )

}
\`\`\`

Create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:

app/page.tsx

\`\`\`
export default function Page() {

  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>

}
\`\`\`

Both `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (`/`).

App Folder Structure

> **Good to know**:
> 
> - If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with `next dev`.
> - You can optionally use a [`src` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder) in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.

### Create the public folder (optional)

Create a [`public` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

You can then reference these assets using the root path (`/`). For example, `public/profile.png` can be referenced as `/profile.png`:

app/page.tsx

\`\`\`
import Image from 'next/image'

 

export default function Page() {

  return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />

}
\`\`\`

## Run the development server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit the `app/page.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

## Set up TypeScript

> Minimum TypeScript version: `v4.5.2`

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx` and run `next dev`. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.

### IDE Plugin

Next.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.

You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:

1. Opening the command palette (`Ctrl/⌘` + `Shift` + `P`)
2. Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
3. Selecting "Use Workspace Version"
![TypeScript Command Palette](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ftypescript-command-palette.png&w=1920&q=75)

TypeScript Command Palette

See the [TypeScript reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typescript) page for more information.

## Set up ESLint

Next.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with `create-next-app`.

To manually add ESLint to an existing project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:

package.json

\`\`\`
{

  "scripts": {

    "lint": "next lint"

  }

}
\`\`\`

Then, run `npm run lint` and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.

Terminal

\`\`\`
npm run lint
\`\`\`

You'll see a prompt like this:

> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?
> 
> ❯ Strict (recommended) Base Cancel

- **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.
- **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.
- **Cancel**: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.

If `Strict` or `Base` are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create a configuration file in the root of your project.

The ESLint config generated by `next lint` uses the older `.eslintrc.json` format. ESLint supports both [the legacy `.eslintrc.json` and the newer `eslint.config.mjs` format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuring-eslint).

You can manually replace `.eslintrc.json` with an `eslint.config.mjs` file using the setup recommended in our [ESLint API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#with-core-web-vitals), and installing the [`@eslint/eslintrc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/eslintrc) package. This more closely matches the ESLint setup used by `create-next-app`.

You can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.

See the [ESLint Plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/eslint) page for more information.

## Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files.

These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:

\`\`\`
// Before

import { Button } from '../../../components/button'

 

// After

import { Button } from '@/components/button'
\`\`\`

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. For example:

\`\`\`
{

  "compilerOptions": {

    "baseUrl": "src/"

  }

}
\`\`\`

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to `"alias"` module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

\`\`\`
{

  "compilerOptions": {

    "baseUrl": "src/",

    "paths": {

      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],

      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]

    }

  }

}
\`\`\`

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.
