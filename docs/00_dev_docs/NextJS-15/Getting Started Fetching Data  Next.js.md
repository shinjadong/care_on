[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started) Fetching Data

## Fetching Data

This page will walk you through how you can fetch data in [Server and Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components), and how to [stream](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#streaming) components that depend on data.

## Fetching data

### Server Components

You can fetch data in Server Components using:

1. The [`fetch` API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#with-the-fetch-api)
2. An [ORM or database](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#with-an-orm-or-database)

#### With the fetch API

To fetch data with the `fetch` API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the `fetch` call. For example:

app/blog/page.tsx

```
export default async function Page() {

  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')

  const posts = await data.json()

  return (

    <ul>

      {posts.map((post) => (

        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>

      ))}

    </ul>

  )

}
```

> **Good to know:**
> 
> - `fetch` responses are not cached by default. However, Next.js will [prerender](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#static-rendering) the route and the output will be cached for improved performance. If you'd like to opt into [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#dynamic-rendering), use the `{ cache: 'no-store' }` option. See the [`fetch` API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch).
> - During development, you can log `fetch` calls for better visibility and debugging. See the [`logging` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/logging).

#### With an ORM or database

Since Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. Turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the call:

app/blog/page.tsx

```
import { db, posts } from '@/lib/db'

 

export default async function Page() {

  const allPosts = await db.select().from(posts)

  return (

    <ul>

      {allPosts.map((post) => (

        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>

      ))}

    </ul>

  )

}
```

### Client Components

There are two ways to fetch data in Client Components, using:

1. React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)
2. A community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

#### Streaming data with the use hook

You can use React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) to [stream](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#streaming) data from the server to client. Start by fetching data in your Server component, and pass the promise to your Client Component as prop:

app/blog/page.tsx

```
import Posts from '@/app/ui/posts'

import { Suspense } from 'react'

 

export default function Page() {

  // Don't await the data fetching function

  const posts = getPosts()

 

  return (

    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>

      <Posts posts={posts} />

    </Suspense>

  )

}
```

Then, in your Client Component, use the `use` hook to read the promise:

app/ui/posts.tsx

```
'use client'

import { use } from 'react'

 

export default function Posts({

  posts,

}: {

  posts: Promise<{ id: string; title: string }[]>

}) {

  const allPosts = use(posts)

 

  return (

    <ul>

      {allPosts.map((post) => (

        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>

      ))}

    </ul>

  )

}
```

In the example above, the `<Posts>` component is wrapped in a [`<Suspense>` boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). This means the fallback will be shown while the promise is being resolved. Learn more about [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#streaming).

#### Community libraries

You can use a community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to fetch data in Client Components. These libraries have their own semantics for caching, streaming, and other features. For example, with SWR:

app/blog/page.tsx

```
'use client'

import useSWR from 'swr'

 

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())

 

export default function BlogPage() {

  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(

    'https://api.vercel.app/blog',

    fetcher

  )

 

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>

  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>

 

  return (

    <ul>

      {data.map((post: { id: string; title: string }) => (

        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>

      ))}

    </ul>

  )

}
```

## Deduplicate requests and cache data

One way to deduplicate `fetch` requests is with [request memoization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#request-memoization). With this mechanism, `fetch` calls using `GET` or `HEAD` with the same URL and options in a single render pass are combined into one request. This happens automatically, and you can [opt out](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#opting-out) by passing an Abort signal to `fetch`.

Request memoization is scoped to the lifetime of a request.

You can also deduplicate `fetch` requests by using Next.jsâ€™ [Data Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#data-cache), for example by setting `cache: 'force-cache'` in your `fetch` options.

Data Cache allows sharing data across the current render pass and incoming requests.

If you are *not* using `fetch`, and instead using an ORM or database directly, you can wrap your data access with the [React `cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) function.

app/lib/data.ts

```
import { cache } from 'react'

import { db, posts, eq } from '@/lib/db'

 

export const getPost = cache(async (id: string) => {

  const post = await db.query.posts.findFirst({

    where: eq(posts.id, parseInt(id)),

  })

})
```

## Streaming

> **Warning:** The content below assumes the [`cacheComponents` config option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) is enabled in your application. The flag was introduced in Next.js 15 canary.

When using `async/await` in Server Components, Next.js will opt into [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#dynamic-rendering). This means the data will be fetched and rendered on the server for every user request. If there are any slow data requests, the whole route will be blocked from rendering.

To improve the initial load time and user experience, you can use streaming to break up the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fserver-rendering-with-streaming.png&w=1920&q=75)

How Server Rendering with Streaming Works

There are two ways you can implement streaming in your application:

1. Wrapping a page with a [`loading.js` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#with-loadingjs)
2. Wrapping a component with [`<Suspense>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#with-suspense)

You can create a `loading.js` file in the same folder as your page to stream the **entire page** while the data is being fetched. For example, to stream `app/blog/page.js`, add the file inside the `app/blog` folder.

![Blog folder structure with loading.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-file.png&w=1920&q=75)

Blog folder structure with loading.js file

app/blog/loading.tsx

```
export default function Loading() {

  // Define the Loading UI here

  return <div>Loading...</div>

}
```

On navigation, the user will immediately see the layout and a [loading state](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#creating-meaningful-loading-states) while the page is being rendered. The new content will then be automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

![Loading UI](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-ui.png&w=1920&q=75)

Loading UI

Behind-the-scenes, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`, and will automatically wrap the `page.js` file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

![loading.js overview](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-overview.png&w=1920&q=75)

loading.js overview

This approach works well for route segments (layouts and pages), but for more granular streaming, you can use `<Suspense>`.

### With <Suspense>

`<Suspense>` allows you to be more granular about what parts of the page to stream. For example, you can immediately show any page content that falls outside of the `<Suspense>` boundary, and stream in the list of blog posts inside the boundary.

An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately to the user after navigation. For the best user experience, we recommend designing loading states that are meaningful and help users understand the app is responding. For example, you can use skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc.

In development, you can preview and inspect the loading state of your components using the [React Devtools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).

## Examples

### Sequential data fetching

Sequential data fetching happens when nested components in a tree each fetch their own data and the requests are not [deduplicated](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#request-memoization), leading to longer response times.

![Sequential and Parallel Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fsequential-parallel-data-fetching.png&w=1920&q=75)

Sequential and Parallel Data Fetching

There may be cases where you want this pattern because one fetch depends on the result of the other.

For example, the `<Playlists>` component will only start fetching data once the `<Artist>` component has finished fetching data because `<Playlists>` depends on the `artistID` prop:

app/artist/\[username\]/page.tsx

```
export default async function Page({

  params,

}: {

  params: Promise<{ username: string }>

}) {

  const { username } = await params

  // Get artist information

  const artist = await getArtist(username)

 

  return (

    <>

      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>

      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}

      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>

        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}

        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />

      </Suspense>

    </>

  )

}

 

async function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {

  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists

  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)

 

  return (

    <ul>

      {playlists.map((playlist) => (

        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>

      ))}

    </ul>

  )

}
```

To improve the user experience, you should use [React `<Suspense>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#streaming) to show a `fallback` while data is being fetch. This will enable [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/#streaming) and prevent the whole route from being blocked by the sequential data requests.

### Parallel data fetching

Parallel data fetching happens when data requests in a route are eagerly initiated and start at the same time.

By default, [layouts and pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) are rendered in parallel. So each segment starts fetching data as soon as possible.

However, within *any* component, multiple `async` / `await` requests can still be sequential if placed after the other. For example, `getAlbums` will be blocked until `getArtist` is resolved:

app/artist/\[username\]/page.tsx

```
import { getArtist, getAlbums } from '@/app/lib/data'

 

export default async function Page({ params }) {

  // These requests will be sequential

  const { username } = await params

  const artist = await getArtist(username)

  const albums = await getAlbums(username)

  return <div>{artist.name}</div>

}
```

You can initiate requests in parallel by defining them outside the components that use the data, and resolving them together, for example, with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all):

app/artist/\[username\]/page.tsx

```
import Albums from './albums'

 

async function getArtist(username: string) {

  const res = await fetch(\`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}\`)

  return res.json()

}

 

async function getAlbums(username: string) {

  const res = await fetch(\`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums\`)

  return res.json()

}

 

export default async function Page({

  params,

}: {

  params: Promise<{ username: string }>

}) {

  const { username } = await params

  const artistData = getArtist(username)

  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)

 

  // Initiate both requests in parallel

  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])

 

  return (

    <>

      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>

      <Albums list={albums} />

    </>

  )

}
```

> **Good to know:** If one request fails when using `Promise.all`, the entire operation will fail. To handle this, you can use the [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) method instead.

You can preload data by creating an utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests. `<Item>` conditionally renders based on the `checkIsAvailable()` function.

You can call `preload()` before `checkIsAvailable()` to eagerly initiate `<Item/>` data dependencies. By the time `<Item/>` is rendered, its data has already been fetched.

app/item/\[id\]/page.tsx

```
import { getItem, checkIsAvailable } from '@/lib/data'

 

export default async function Page({

  params,

}: {

  params: Promise<{ id: string }>

}) {

  const { id } = await params

  // starting loading item data

  preload(id)

  // perform another asynchronous task

  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()

 

  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null

}

 

export const preload = (id: string) => {

  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined

  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void

  void getItem(id)

}

export async function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {

  const result = await getItem(id)

  // ...

}
```

Additionally, you can use React's [`cache` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) and the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) to create a reusable utility function. This approach allows you to cache the data fetching function and ensure that it's only executed on the server.

utils/get-item.ts

```
import { cache } from 'react'

import 'server-only'

import { getItem } from '@/lib/data'

 

export const preload = (id: string) => {

  void getItem(id)

}

 

export const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {

  // ...

})
```
