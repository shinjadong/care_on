# Feedback on Project Directory Structure

Your project structure is **well-organized and follows a Clean Architecture approach**. It aligns with the recommendations we discussed earlier. Next.js doesn’t force a specific structure, so adopting a layered architecture like this is a valid choice. Below, I’ll review each part of the structure and provide feedback, then outline some next steps (homework) for further implementation.

## Overall Structure and Clean Architecture Layers

You have essentially split the codebase into the classic layers of **domain**, **application**, **infrastructure**, and **presentation**, alongside Next.js’s app directory for routing. This is a sound strategy for maintainability and separation of concerns. In fact, a similar folder layout is used in Clean Architecture examples for Next.js[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=%2Fsrc%2F%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20domain%2F%20%20,js%20App%20Router%20entry%20points). Here’s how your structure maps to the layers:

* **Domain (lib/domain)** – Enterprise business logic and data models (core entities).

* **Application (lib/application)** – Application-specific logic and use cases that orchestrate domain and infrastructure.

* **Infrastructure (lib/infrastructure)** – Implementation details (database access, external services, file storage, etc.).

* **Presentation** – In your case, this includes both the UI components/pages (the Next.js app directory and components/) and the API layer (tRPC). This is the outer layer that interfaces with the user or client.

This layering is great for keeping your core logic independent. It means, for example, domain logic doesn’t depend on Next.js or Prisma or any external framework[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=The%20domain%20layer%20contains%20enterprise,as%20emphasized%20in%20Part%20One). Overall, the high-level layout looks correct and adheres to the principles we discussed (independence of UI, database, etc., per Clean Architecture).

## Next.js App Directory and UI Components (Presentation Layer)

Your Next.js app/ directory contains the routing entry points (e.g. app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, and the API route under app/api/trpc/\[trpc\]/route.ts). By using the **App Router** (since this is Next 13+), you benefit from built-in routing conventions. It’s good to see globals.css, layout.tsx, etc., in place – those are standard for Next.js.

You also have a separate top-level components/ folder (with subfolders like providers/ and ui/). This is perfectly fine – Next.js is quite flexible about organizing components. In fact, one common pattern is exactly what you did: keeping reusable UI components in a dedicated folder (possibly organized by feature or type) outside the app pages[\[3\]](https://github.com/shinjadong/care_on/blob/bd0b04c4e4794bc0362130f0a540339405525b16/docs/00_dev_docs/architecture.md#L95-L103). This keeps your pages (in app/) focused on composition, while the UI pieces reside in components/.

* **components/providers** – contains things like TRPCProvider.tsx. This likely sets up context providers (e.g. wrapping the app with tRPC’s React Query provider). Make sure you **use this provider in your app’s layout**. Typically, you would import and include \<TRPCProvider\> in app/layout.tsx (or a similar root component) so that all child components can use tRPC hooks. The Codevoweb guide, for example, suggests wrapping the app in a tRPC provider in the root layout[\[4\]](https://codevoweb.com/setup-trpc-server-and-client-in-nextjs-13-app-directory/#:~:text=Add%20the%20tRPC%20Provider%20to,js%2013)[\[5\]](https://codevoweb.com/setup-trpc-server-and-client-in-nextjs-13-app-directory/#:~:text=%3Chtml%20lang%3D,%29%3B). Ensure your layout is doing this (if not, that’s a quick fix to implement).

* **components/ui** – will hold presentational UI components (buttons, form inputs, etc., and possibly more feature-specific components). The structure under components/ui is up to you; you might organize by design system elements or keep shared UI here. This separation is good for reusability.

Overall, the **presentation layer** of your app (UI \+ Next pages) is structured well. The pages (in app/) handle routing, and they can pull in components from components/ as needed. Continue to ensure that **no heavy business logic lives in the pages or components** – they should ideally call into the application layer or tRPC APIs for complex operations. This keeps the UI layer clean.

## API Layer with tRPC (Presentation/Interface)

You have set up an API route for tRPC at app/api/trpc/\[trpc\]/route.ts, and the supporting tRPC logic under lib/presentation/api/trpc. This is a modern and effective way to structure your backend API within a Next.js App Router project. The dynamic route \[trpc\] with route.ts will catch all tRPC calls. Typically, inside route.ts you’d use fetchRequestHandler from tRPC to forward requests to your tRPC router[\[6\]](https://codevoweb.com/setup-trpc-server-and-client-in-nextjs-13-app-directory/#:~:text=import%20,router)[\[7\]](https://codevoweb.com/setup-trpc-server-and-client-in-nextjs-13-app-directory/#:~:text=req%3A%20request%2C%20router%3A%20appRouter%2C%20createContext%3A,%7D%2C%20%7D%29%3B). Make sure that your route.ts is correctly invoking the tRPC app router. For example, something like:

// app/api/trpc/\[trpc\]/route.ts (example)  
import { fetchRequestHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch';  
import { appRouter } from '@/lib/presentation/api/trpc/server';  // your TRPC router  
import { createContext } from '@/lib/presentation/api/trpc/context';

const handler \= (req: Request) \=\> {  
  return fetchRequestHandler({  
    router: appRouter,  
    req,  
    endpoint: "/api/trpc",  
    createContext,  // use your context if needed for auth/db  
  });  
};

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

If your implementation looks similar to the above, then you’re on the right track. This structure keeps Next-specific API wiring (route.ts) minimal, delegating all the logic to your **tRPC router definitions in lib/presentation/api/trpc**.

Inside lib/presentation/api/trpc/, you have files like client.ts, context.ts, server.ts, trpc.ts, and a routers directory. Some feedback on these:

* **trpc.ts** – This probably initializes the tRPC instance (using initTRPC). It’s good to centralize things like transformer (e.g. SuperJSON) and middleware here. Ensure you export your t (the initialized TRPC helper) and maybe some base procedures if needed (e.g. t.middleware, t.procedure).

* **routers/** – You might organize your tRPC routers by domain (e.g. a router for product, one for customer, etc.). For example, you could have lib/presentation/api/trpc/routers/product.ts defining product-related procedures. Then in server.ts you combine them into the root appRouter. If you haven’t yet, I recommend structuring it this way:

* Define individual routers per domain or feature.

* In server.ts, import and merge them, e.g. export const appRouter \= t.router({ product: productRouter, customer: customerRouter, ... }).

* Also export AppRouter type from server.ts for the client to use.

* **context.ts** – This should create the context for each request (for tRPC procedures). If your app needs things like authentication info or a database connection per request, set it up here. For instance, you might attach a Prisma client or Supabase client to the context, so your procedures can access it. If currently your context is empty (or just {}), consider what you might need (e.g., user from headers/session, or database connection). Even if not needed now, having the scaffold is good. *(If using Prisma, you might just import the Prisma client directly in procedures instead of via context – both approaches are fine.)*

* **client.ts** – On the client side, this likely configures the tRPC client. For example, using createTRPCReact\<AppRouter\>() or setting up a proxy client with Next’s App Router compatibility. Ensure that this is used by your TRPCProvider (it likely is). The typical pattern (if not using createTRPCNext due to App Router) is:

* import { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react-query';  
  import type { AppRouter } from '@/lib/presentation/api/trpc/server';  
  export const trpc \= createTRPCReact\<AppRouter\>();

* Then in TRPCProvider.tsx, create a trpcClient using createTRPCProxyClient or similar (depending on your setup) and wrap \<trpc.Provider value={trpcClient}\> around children, along with React Query’s QueryClientProvider. It looks like you have this in place (as you have a TRPCProvider.tsx). Just double-check that the provider is indeed wrapping your app (as mentioned earlier).

In summary, the API structure with tRPC is looking good. It separates the **API contract** (the procedures and routers in lib/presentation) from the Next.js API route handler (in app/api). This keeps your business logic decoupled from the framework’s specifics.

One small suggestion: consider grouping your **API code under the application layer** logically. Right now, it’s under lib/presentation, which is okay (since it's an interface to the outside world). Some projects treat API controllers or routers as part of the presentation layer (interface adapters), which is what you’ve done. Just ensure that your tRPC procedures **call into the application layer** (services/use-cases) rather than directly doing a lot of work themselves. For example, a createReview tRPC mutation might call an application service like ReviewService.create(reviewData) in lib/application, which in turn uses domain logic and infrastructure. This will keep a clean separation: tRPC just translates the HTTP request to a method call and returns a response, while the real logic lives deeper in the app.

## Domain Layer (lib/domain)

Your lib/domain folder is organized by sub-domains (contract, customer, enrollment, product, review). This is a sensible way to partition your core **business logic and entities**. Each subfolder can contain the types, entities, and domain services specific to that concept. For example, lib/domain/product/ might have a Product entity (TypeScript interface or class) and perhaps domain-specific operations (e.g. a function to calculate a product’s discount or validate product data). The **domain layer should be pure logic**, with **no external dependencies** – no direct database calls, no network calls, no UI code. It defines what your business **is** and **does** at a high level.

A few suggestions for the domain layer structure and contents:

* **Define Entities/Models**: If not already, create TypeScript types or interfaces for your core entities. For instance, in lib/domain/contract/, define what a Contract object looks like (fields, etc). These could be simple interfaces or classes. The example from Clean Architecture shows a domain entity defined as a TS interface with basic fields and no methods[\[8\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=Our%20,item%20is%20in%20our%20system)[\[9\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=Notice%20that%20our%20entity%20is,represents%20a%20pure%20business%20concept). Keeping them simple and framework-free is key.

* **Domain Logic**: Include any business rules or computations. For example, if there’s a rule “a review cannot be edited after 7 days”, that logic could live in a function or class method in lib/domain/review/. Domain services (business operations that don’t belong to a single entity) can also be placed here or in the application layer – but if they only involve domain concepts (and not external resources), you can keep them in domain.

* **No External Imports**: Ensure that these domain files do not import from Next.js, tRPC, database libraries, etc. They can import from utility libraries (like date-fns, etc.) or define pure functions. This keeps the domain **independent**. (This independence is a core Clean Architecture principle – e.g., the domain should not know about database or HTTP contexts[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=The%20domain%20layer%20contains%20enterprise,as%20emphasized%20in%20Part%20One).)

* **Repository Interfaces** (Optional but recommended): A great practice is to define abstract interfaces in the domain for data access. For example, you could have lib/domain/customer/CustomerRepository.ts interface that outlines methods like findById(id), save(customer), etc., without implementing them. This interface represents what the domain *needs* from a persistence mechanism, but not how it’s done. The actual implementation will be in infrastructure. By defining the interface in domain, your application layer can depend on the interface (in domain) without depending on the concrete database code. (This is the Dependency Inversion principle.) For instance, a snippet for a repository interface might look like:

// lib/domain/customer/CustomerRepository.ts  
import { Customer } from "./CustomerEntity";  
export interface CustomerRepository {  
  findById(id: string): Promise\<Customer | null\>;  
  save(customer: Customer): Promise\<void\>;  
  // ...other methods as needed  
}

This pattern is shown in many Clean Architecture examples (the domain layer defines the interface)[\[10\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=Repository%20Interface). Implementations of these interfaces will go in lib/infrastructure (see below).

In summary, **lib/domain is the heart of your system**. The structure you have is on the right track. Now it’s about populating these folders with the actual domain logic. Think of each subfolder as a mini-module for that concept, containing all the pure business knowledge about that concept.

## Application Layer (lib/application)

The application layer is currently an empty folder (from the structure listing) – but it’s meant to house **use cases and services** that coordinate the work. In Clean Architecture, this layer sits between domain and infrastructure, handling things like:

* **Use Case Coordination**: e.g., “Enroll a customer in a program” – this might involve validating a customer (domain), creating an enrollment record (domain), and saving it via a repository (infrastructure). The function or service that orchestrates this lives in the application layer. It can call multiple domain functions and multiple infrastructure services to fulfill a workflow.

* **Business Rules at Application Level**: Some rules are not low-level domain rules but application-specific. For example, “If a customer enrolls, send a confirmation email.” Triggering that email (via an external service) is an application-level concern. The domain might not know about “emails” at all, it just knows about enrollments; the application layer would coordinate between the Enrollment domain and an Email service (infrastructure).

* **Transaction Scripts or Services**: You might create a file or class per use-case or per aggregate of functionality. For instance, a CustomerService with methods like enrollCustomer(...), terminateContract(...) which use domain entities and call repositories.

Given the domain subdomains you have, a matching approach could be to create corresponding application services or use-case functions. Perhaps something like lib/application/contract/ContractService.ts for contract-related operations that need both domain and infrastructure. Or you can structure by use-case: e.g., lib/application/enrollment/createEnrollment.ts function.

The key idea: **Application layer functions should be the ones your controllers (or tRPC procedures) call to actually perform tasks.** They **use domain logic** (e.g., create domain objects, check business rules) and then **use infrastructure** (e.g., call repository implementations, send notifications). This layer **knows about domain and infrastructure** and glues them together, but doesn’t do trivial things itself – it delegates to domain or infrastructure for actual work.

For example, if we were implementing a “write a review” feature: \- In domain: we have a Review entity and maybe a ReviewValidator. \- In application: a function submitReview(productId, customerId, content) would orchestrate: check via domain validator if the content meets criteria, create a Review entity, call ReviewRepository.save(review) from infrastructure, and perhaps call an external service (like send a thank-you email) via an infrastructure service. The application function handles the sequence and error handling. \- The tRPC mutation createReview would simply call this application function and return the result or error.

This separation ensures your **application logic is testable** without the web layer. You can unit test the application services by mocking the domain (if needed) and infrastructure.

Right now, since the folder is empty, your next task will be to start implementing these use cases as the need arises. It might help to start with a simple one for each domain area. For instance, if you have a Product domain, maybe implement a listProducts use-case in application that pulls products from a repository and maybe does some filtering logic.

Remember that the **application layer depends on domain (for entities and rules)** and on **infrastructure abstractions**. It can import domain types easily. For infrastructure, if you use the interface pattern as mentioned, your application can import the domain’s ...Repository interface and call its methods. How to get an instance of the repository? You might instantiate an implementation from infrastructure at runtime, or use dependency injection. In a simple approach, you could import an implementation directly in the service (which couples it, but as long as the interface is there, testing can still mock it by swapping imports). A more advanced approach might pass implementations via the tRPC context or use a simple DI container. For now, don’t over-engineer it – you can call the infrastructure code directly, just keep the **conceptual separation** clear.

**Feedback summary for application layer:** The folder is ready – now fill it with the logic that makes your features work. Aim for one place to handle each use-case. This will prevent your tRPC procedures or React components from having too much logic.

*(On a related note: since you are using Next.js App Router, you could also leverage* *Server Actions* *for some use cases (as seen in some examples)[\[11\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=%2F%2F%20src%2Fapp%2Factions%2FtodoActions.ts%20%28excerpt%29%20)[\[12\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=,Promise%3CTodo%3E). Server Actions are a Next.js feature to handle form submissions or actions on the server without an API call. However, since you have tRPC set up, you might not need Next’s server actions. Your tRPC is essentially fulfilling that role in a more structured way. So focusing on application services \+ tRPC is fine.)*

## Infrastructure Layer (lib/infrastructure)

Under lib/infrastructure, you have subfolders for database, external, and storage. This is a logical categorization of infrastructure concerns:

* **database** – likely contains database client setup and repository implementations. Since you have a Prisma setup (prisma/schema.prisma exists), you will generate a Prisma Client. You might create a file like database/prisma.ts to initialize the Prisma client and handle connections. Also, for each domain entity, you can write a repository implementation here. For example, database/CustomerRepoPrisma.ts could implement the CustomerRepository interface using Prisma queries. Keeping the naming consistent helps (e.g., PrismaCustomerRepository that implements the domain’s CustomerRepository interface). This folder can also include any raw SQL or query builders if needed.

* **external** – for integrating with external APIs or services (third-party services). From your code snippet, I notice references to things like a **Cloudflare Worker for SMS** (CLOUDFLARE\_WORKER\_URL) and possibly Supabase. If you have logic to call those, that should reside here. For instance, you might have external/SMSService.ts that contains functions to send SMS via your Cloudflare worker endpoint. Similarly, if using Supabase for certain features (like maybe storage or auth), wrapping Supabase calls in this layer is wise. That way, the rest of your app can call a function like sendVerificationSMS(phone) from a service in lib/infrastructure/external, without knowing the details of the HTTP fetch.

* **storage** – presumably for file storage (maybe if you integrate with AWS S3 or similar, or store files locally). If your project involves file uploads or static content management, put that handling here. E.g., storage/FileStorage.ts could contain logic to upload files to cloud storage.

A few implementation tips for infrastructure:

* **Prisma Integration**: After defining your schema.prisma, run npx prisma generate to create the client. Ensure you have a .env with the database URL (and that .env is listed in .gitignore which it is, given .env.example). In the infrastructure layer, you might create a singleton instance of Prisma Client to reuse across calls (Prisma handles pooling internally for serverless environments). For example:

* // lib/infrastructure/database/prisma.ts  
  import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";  
  export const prisma \= new PrismaClient();

* Then your repository files can import this prisma.

* **Repository Implementations**: For each repository interface in domain, implement it here. Following our earlier example:

* // lib/infrastructure/database/PrismaCustomerRepository.ts  
  import { prisma } from "./prisma";  
  import { CustomerRepository } from "@/lib/domain/customer/CustomerRepository";  
  import { Customer } from "@/lib/domain/customer/CustomerEntity";

  export const PrismaCustomerRepository: CustomerRepository \= {  
    async findById(id: string): Promise\<Customer|null\> {  
      const result \= await prisma.customer.findUnique({ where: { id } });  
      if (\!result) return null;  
      // Map Prisma result to domain Customer (if they differ)  
      return {  
        id: result.id,  
        name: result.name,  
        // ...other fields  
      };  
    },  
    async save(customer: Customer): Promise\<void\> {  
      await prisma.customer.create({ data: customer });  
    },  
    // ...other methods  
  };

* This is just an illustration; adapt it to your actual schema and needs. The idea is the *infrastructure knows about Prisma and the database schema*, and it converts to/from the domain models.

* **External Services**: For each external integration, create a module. E.g., external/sms.ts with a function sendSMS(phone: string, message: string). This function might use fetch(CLOUDFLARE\_WORKER\_URL, {...}) or an SDK. Keep any API keys or config at the top (and use environment variables for secrets). By isolating this here, if you later switch SMS provider, you only change this file. Your application layer might have a service that calls sms.sendSMS() when needed (and you could mock it in tests).

* **Error Handling**: In infrastructure functions, handle errors gracefully. Wrap external calls in try/catch and throw domain-specific errors if needed (or return Result objects). For instance, if Prisma throws, you might catch and throw a custom error that the application layer can recognize (or simply log and rethrow).

* **Database Migrations**: Keep your prisma/schema.prisma updated as your domain evolves, and run prisma migrate dev to apply changes in development. Since you provided a schema.prisma, ensure the domain models align with it. For example, if you have a Product domain entity, ensure Product table/fields exist in the schema.

Your separation of database vs external vs storage is good – it indicates you plan to handle different kinds of infrastructure separately. Just remember that **infrastructure should implement the contracts needed by the application**. The application (or domain) will say “I need to save a Contract” (via a repository interface or similar), and infrastructure provides that ability (Prisma or other client doing the actual save).

Also, note that **infrastructure can depend on domain types** (e.g., use the domain Customer type to ensure the data you return matches what domain expects). This is fine, since it’s an outer layer depending on an inner layer (allowed in Clean Architecture). Just avoid the reverse (domain depending on infrastructure).

## Additional Suggested Tasks (Next Steps for the AI Developer)

Given this structure, here are some concrete next steps (“homework”) to complete the implementation. I'll list them with specific instructions and tips:

1. **Define Domain Models and Interfaces**: Go through each subfolder in lib/domain (contract, customer, enrollment, product, review) and add the core definitions:

2. Create a TypeScript interface or type for the main entity (e.g. Product, Customer, etc.). Include all necessary fields, using primitive types or other domain types (no external library types). For example, a Customer might have id, name, email, etc., and a Contract might have details of an agreement.

3. If applicable, define value objects or enums for specific concepts (e.g., an enum for ContractStatus).

4. (Optional) In each domain subfolder, define a **repository interface** if you will use one (as discussed above). For example, contract/ContractRepository.ts with methods your app needs (find, save, list, etc.).

5. **Feedback**: Once implemented, you should have a clear picture of your domain’s language. You can even write a few unit tests for domain functions if any business rules (e.g., a function canCustomerEnroll(customer, product): boolean that encodes a rule).

6. **Implement Application Use-Cases/Services**: For each major feature, create functions in lib/application to perform that use-case. Some suggestions:

7. In lib/application/contract/, create functions like createContract(data) or terminateContract(id) that handle the process of creating or ending a contract. Inside, use domain entities (e.g., construct a Contract object) and call infrastructure (e.g., ContractRepository.save).

8. In lib/application/enrollment/, maybe a function enrollCustomer(customerId, productId) that checks eligibility (maybe using domain logic) and then creates an enrollment via repository.

9. Ensure each function focuses on the *workflow*: e.g., validation → calling domain logic → saving via repo → returning a result (perhaps the created object or a confirmation).

10. If any external side effects are needed (like sending an email or SMS on certain actions), call the corresponding infrastructure service here.

11. **Feedback**: Try to keep these functions free of UI concerns – they shouldn’t console.log to UI or set state (that’s for the presentation layer). They just take input, interact with domain & infrastructure, and return output or throw errors. That will make them easy to test and reuse. Document these functions clearly (comments about what they do, expected behavior on error, etc.).

12. **Connect tRPC Routers to Application Layer**: Now that you’ll have application services, make sure your tRPC procedures call them:

13. For example, if you have a productRouter in tRPC with a procedure getProducts, implement it by calling an application layer function listProducts() which fetches from the database via a repository. Similarly, a createReview mutation should call an application layer submitReview() function.

14. This keeps your tRPC routes very thin and focused on input/output (e.g., input validation could be done via zod in tRPC router, then pass the clean data to the app layer).

15. Ensure proper error handling: if your application function throws (e.g., domain rule violation), you might catch it and throw a tRPC error or return a safe result. tRPC can automatically map exceptions to errors if not caught. Consider using TRPCError for expected errors (like authentication issues or validations) so the client gets a proper error response.

16. **Feedback**: This step is crucial for Clean Architecture – it’s where the outer layer (tRPC) connects to the inner layers. After this, you should be able to call your tRPC endpoints from the front-end and have them exercise your core logic.

17. **Infrastructure: Prisma and Repository Implementation**: Dive into the lib/infrastructure/database folder:

18. Initialize the Prisma Client (if not done). Test the connection to your database.

19. Implement the repository classes or objects for each domain entity that needs persistence. As noted, map between Prisma models and domain models. Keep the mapping logic simple and confined to these files.

20. You may want to create a thin abstraction for transactions if needed (Prisma supports transactions; if a use-case spans multiple repos, you can handle it in the application layer by passing a Prisma transaction client or similar, but that might not be needed immediately).

21. If using Supabase or another DB alternative for some data, implement those calls here as well. For instance, if lib/supabase/products.ts exists (I see hints of lib/supabase in your repo), consider whether that is still needed or if Prisma is replacing it. Unify your approach to avoid confusion (using both Prisma and Supabase for data can be done, but make clear which is source of truth for what).

22. **Feedback**: Test each repository method in isolation if possible. For example, write a small script or temporary route to call PrismaCustomerRepository.findById and see if it returns expected data from your dev DB. This will give you confidence that the infrastructure layer is working correctly.

23. **Infrastructure: External Services**:

24. Implement any missing pieces for external integrations. Since you have an SMS service proxy (Cloudflare Worker) and possibly other integrations (maybe external APIs for products or reviews?), ensure each has a function in lib/infrastructure/external. For instance, external/NotificationService.ts that might have sendSignupEmail(user) or sendSMSVerification(phone).

25. Check your CloudflareWorkerURL usage – if currently you call it directly in a React component (as suggested by the constant in CareonApplicationFormCloudflare.tsx), that is fine for now (it likely uses fetch on the client side). But in a cleaner architecture, you might instead call a tRPC mutation that triggers sending SMS via the server (so that secrets or API keys aren’t exposed in front-end). Consider moving that logic to the server side for better security (unless the Cloudflare Worker itself is the secure layer).

26. **Feedback**: External service calls can fail or be slow, so add appropriate timeouts/retries if needed. Also, protect any sensitive info (API keys should come from env vars, not hardcoded). By the end, your lib/infrastructure/external should act as a library for all third-party interactions.

27. **Tie Providers into Next.js**: Ensure that any context providers (like the TRPCProvider, and maybe others like a ThemeProvider or AuthProvider if you have) are properly integrated:

28. We mentioned wrapping TRPCProvider in layout.tsx. Double-check that.

29. If you have global state (maybe using Redux or Context for some client-side state), ensure providers for those are also added at the appropriate level. (From the structure, I see no explicit Redux setup, but if you plan to, it would go in providers too.)

30. **Feedback**: This is more of a sanity check. A properly wrapped provider ensures that your React components can use hooks like trpc.someQuery.useQuery() anywhere in the tree. Test this by calling a simple tRPC query from a page or component to confirm everything is wired up.

31. **Documentation & Refactoring**: As you flesh out the layers, update your documentation (if you have a README or architecture docs) to reflect any changes. Document the purpose of each layer and any decisions (for future contributors or your future self).

32. For example, note that “Domain layer has no deps, and contains X, Y, Z”, “Application layer uses repository interfaces”, etc.

33. Also, as you implement, you might identify small adjustments to structure. Feel free to refine (Clean Architecture is a guideline, not strict rules). For instance, you might decide to add a lib/domain/shared for shared domain utilities, or maybe add a lib/application/middlewares if you have cross-cutting concerns. That’s okay – just remain consistent in keeping separation of concerns.

34. **Feedback**: Keeping the docs in sync will help the AI developer (and any human devs) maintain context. It seems you already have some guides (CLAUDE.md, architecture.md) – consider adding a section summarizing this structure for quick reference.

By tackling these tasks, you will gradually fill in all the skeleton folders you created with real, functional code. The end result will be a robust project where each piece has a clear responsibility:

* **Domain**: what your business entities are and can do (rules).

* **Application**: how those rules are applied to accomplish tasks, in coordination with tech details.

* **Infrastructure**: technical details of databases, APIs, etc.

* **Presentation (UI & API)**: how the outside world interacts with your application (web UI or API calls).

Each layer interacts with the next in a controlled manner, which is exactly the goal of this architecture. 👍

## Final Thoughts

Your directory structure looks correct and is a great start. The fact that it mirrors recommended patterns is a good sign that you’re on the right path[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@entekumejeffrey/clean-architecture-in-next-js-14-a-practical-guide-part-two-3e5d8dbf5a7c#:~:text=%2Fsrc%2F%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20domain%2F%20%20,js%20App%20Router%20entry%20points). The next steps involve actually implementing the code in each section and ensuring everything works together. Keep the following principles in mind as you proceed:

* **Separation of Concerns**: Always ask, “Which layer should this code live in?” For example, “formatting a date for display” – that’s a presentation concern (could even be a UI helper). “Calculating next billing date” – that’s domain logic. “Saving a record to DB” – infrastructure. This will guide where to put new code.

* **Dependency Direction**: Inner layers (domain, application) should not import from outer layers. Outer can import inner. This ensures, for instance, you could take your domain and use it in a different context (another app, or unit tests) without pulling in a bunch of web or DB stuff.

* **Keep It Simple Initially**: It’s possible to over-abstract things. Don’t create too many interfaces or classes unless they add clarity. It’s fine if, for now, your tRPC calls directly use a Prisma client in a pinch – you can refactor to a repository later. The important thing is the concept of separation. Since you’ve already laid out the folders, you have a blueprint to follow.

Overall, **great job organizing the project**. 🎉 Now it’s a matter of filling in the details. As you implement each part, test it out incrementally: \- Try a simple tRPC query \-\> make sure it hits a function in application \-\> which maybe returns dummy data or fetches from a simple repository. \- Try a mutation \-\> ensure it writes to the DB and returns the result. \- Build from there.

If you run into any issues (for example, integration of tRPC with Next’s App Router, or any folder resolution problems), double-check the Next.js docs and tRPC docs for guidance. Thus far, everything looks in line with expected setups.

Feel free to ask for more feedback as you implement these parts. Good luck with the “homework” tasks – completing them will significantly advance your project. 🚀
